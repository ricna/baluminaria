    /// <summary>@brief
    /// Minimum Viable Product focus on the essentials of a Maestro function. 
    /// Only a few functions are presented. Links to the documentation are provided for further exploration.
    /// Therefore, error tests are absent, the user interface is almost non-existent and manipulations in Unity are reduced. 
    /// 
    /// The goal is rather to learn how to use the Maestro API and then progress by building more complex applications.
    /// Maestro is based on the use of prefabs (MidiFilePlayer, MidiStreamPlayer, …) which must be added in the Unity editor in the hierarchy of your project.
    /// In these demos, we prefer to create the prefabs by script to avoid manipulations in the editor. 
    /// It is rather recommended to create Prefabs in Unity Editor to take advantage of the Inspectors and its many directly accessible parameters.
    /// 
    /// Functionality Demonstrated:
    /// - Enable or disable channels when a MIDI is playing. 
    /// - Keep only the drum channel playing.
    /// - Apply sustain on a specific channel to maintain note playing on this channel (note-off arre disabled until sustain of off)
    ///
    /// How to Use:
    /// 1. Add a MidiFilePlayer prefab to your scene (right click on the Hierarchy Tab, menu Maestro)
    /// 2. Add an empty GameObject to your Unity Scene and attach this script to the GameObject.
    /// 3. In the inspector of the script, defined the channel to apply the sustain.
    /// 4. Run the scene and change the value of HanfChannel in the inspector
    ///
